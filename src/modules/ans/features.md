- modular and transparent
- simple setup and management
- auto updates to both AMS and the node software (speeds up and simplifies node network upgrades)
- health checks with auto-heal to maximize uptime
- simplifies development (developers can target and test specific OS while AMS provides support for main server side OSes)
- security - all modules are audited (does not include audit of node code)
